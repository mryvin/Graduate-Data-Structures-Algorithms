1. The worst-case running time is O(n). This occurs every time, 
as the new list being created must parse through the entirety of the data.

2. The algorithm is optimal as it is not possible to make the algorithm 
run faster than O(n) time.

3. The worst case space utilization is also O(n). This is caused by the creation 
of a new list called new, which at worst is of length n.

4. The lower bound of the performance is O(n). This is because no matter what, 
the algorithm runs through all n values in the inputted list.
