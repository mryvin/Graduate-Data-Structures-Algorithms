    "- **create_directed_graph:** Makes a directed graph using the edges given. When the edge is a Before edge, it is treated as a \"black\" edge and goes from first to second vertex. When the edge is an Overlap edge, two \"red\" edges are made - an edge from first to second vertex and an edge from second to first vertex. If a black edge already exists, the red edge does not replace it.\n",
    "- **is_consistent:** Checks for any loops in the graph. The loop must contain at least one black edge, and two red edges between the same two vertices can not be used. For example, if a red edge exists from A to B and from B to A, only 1 of those edges can be used. \n",
    "- **print_order_with_birth_death:** Vertices connected by red edge are put into groups together, and vertices without red edges are put into groups on their own. Then births are printed in topological order. Deaths are printed once every vertex in a given group has been born"
